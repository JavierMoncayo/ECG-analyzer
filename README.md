# ECG-analyzer
Matlab GUI to load, plot, analyze and filter real ECG signal and model your own ECG.


In this little project I developed a suite where you can load ECG signal from MIT database. In this first part of the suite, you can do analyze the signal, get some statistics about it and apply some filters to it (diferents kind of filters and diferent degree).

In the other part of the suite, you can find a little aplicattion to model your own ECG signal (to model some sick symptom) and the use it to analyze.

I hope you like it!!!
